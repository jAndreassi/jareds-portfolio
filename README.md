# Jared Andreassi's Portfolio

## Description

I wanted to build a portfolio to show employers that I have knowledge to work in web development. In this portfolio I have information about me, projects that I have done and ways to contact me. I learned many things building this webpage. First it was my first item I built from scratch with in the long run should be very helpful. Also, learned to use media quireies, border-radius and flex-box.

## Installation

Steps to using this webpage were using HTML and CSS. Also had to get an avatar, email, github, twitter and linkedin image off the web.
